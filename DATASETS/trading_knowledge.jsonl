{"instruction": "Explain this trading concept", "input": "What is RSI and how is it used in trading?", "output": "RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a momentum oscillator measuring price movement speed and change on a 0-100 scale. Key levels: Below 30 = oversold (potential buy), Above 70 = overbought (potential sell). Best used with trend confirmation. Divergence between price and RSI can signal reversals."}
{"instruction": "Explain this trading concept", "input": "What is MACD and what signals does it generate?", "output": "MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) shows relationship between two EMAs. Components: MACD Line (12 EMA - 26 EMA), Signal Line (9 EMA of MACD), Histogram (difference). Signals: Bullish crossover when MACD crosses above signal, Bearish when below. Zero line crossovers indicate trend changes."}
{"instruction": "Explain this trading concept", "input": "How do Bollinger Bands work?", "output": "Bollinger Bands consist of: Middle band (20 SMA), Upper band (Middle + 2 std dev), Lower band (Middle - 2 std dev). Price touching lower band in uptrend = potential buy. Squeeze (narrow bands) predicts volatility expansion. Bands widening indicates increased volatility."}
{"instruction": "Explain this trading concept", "input": "What is VWAP and why is it important?", "output": "VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) is the average price weighted by volume, resetting daily. Used by institutions for execution benchmarks. Price above VWAP = bullish intraday bias. Price below = bearish. Key support/resistance for day traders. Best for intraday trading only."}
{"instruction": "Explain this trading concept", "input": "What is ATR and how is it used for position sizing?", "output": "ATR (Average True Range) measures volatility over a period (typically 14). Used for: Stop loss placement (1-2x ATR), Position sizing (Risk $ / ATR = shares), Volatility assessment. Higher ATR = more volatile stock. Adjust position size inversely to ATR to maintain consistent risk."}
{"instruction": "Analyze this pattern", "input": "What is a Double Bottom pattern and how do I trade it?", "output": "Double Bottom is a bullish reversal forming 'W' shape. Components: Two similar lows, Peak between them (neckline). Entry: Break above neckline. Stop loss: Below the bottoms. Target: Distance from bottom to neckline, projected above. Confirmation: Volume increase on breakout. More reliable after downtrend."}
{"instruction": "Analyze this pattern", "input": "Explain the Head and Shoulders pattern", "output": "Head and Shoulders is a bearish reversal pattern. Structure: Left shoulder (lower high), Head (highest high), Right shoulder (lower high, similar to left), Neckline (connecting the troughs). Entry: Break below neckline. Stop: Above right shoulder. Target: Height of head projected below neckline. Inverse H&S is bullish."}
{"instruction": "Analyze this pattern", "input": "What is a Bull Flag pattern?", "output": "Bull Flag is a continuation pattern after strong upward move. Components: Flagpole (sharp rally), Flag (tight consolidation with slight downward slope). Entry: Break above flag resistance. Stop: Below flag low. Target: Flagpole height added to breakout point. Volume should decrease during flag, increase on breakout."}
{"instruction": "Analyze this pattern", "input": "How do I identify and trade a Cup and Handle?", "output": "Cup and Handle is bullish continuation pattern. Cup: U-shaped recovery after decline. Handle: Small pullback forming flag. Entry: Break above handle resistance. Stop: Below handle low. Target: Cup depth projected above breakout. Cup should be 1-6 months. Handle should retrace 1/3 of cup. Volume rises on breakout."}
{"instruction": "Analyze this pattern", "input": "What is an Ascending Triangle?", "output": "Ascending Triangle is typically bullish. Structure: Flat resistance line, Rising support (higher lows). Shows buyers becoming more aggressive. Entry: Break above resistance. Stop: Below most recent higher low. Target: Triangle height projected above breakout. Usually continues prior trend. Volume contracts then expands on breakout."}
{"instruction": "Trading strategy question", "input": "How should I set my stop loss?", "output": "Stop loss placement strategies: 1) ATR-based: 1-2x ATR below entry for longs. 2) Support-based: Below key support level. 3) Percentage-based: 1-2% below entry (simple but not adaptive). 4) Pattern-based: Below pattern's key level. Never risk more than 1-2% of account per trade. Wider stops need smaller position sizes."}
{"instruction": "Trading strategy question", "input": "What is a good risk-reward ratio?", "output": "Minimum risk-reward should be 1:1.5, ideally 1:2 or better. Example: If risking $100, target should be at least $150-200. With 1:2 ratio, you can be profitable with only 40% win rate. Calculate before entry: (Target - Entry) / (Entry - Stop) = R:R. Never enter if R:R is below your minimum threshold."}
{"instruction": "Trading strategy question", "input": "How do I calculate position size?", "output": "Position sizing formula: Shares = Risk Amount / (Entry Price - Stop Loss). Example: $100 risk, entry $50, stop $48 → $100 / $2 = 50 shares. Never risk more than 1-2% of account per trade. For volatile stocks (high ATR), reduce size. For concentrated positions, reduce size. This maintains consistent risk across trades."}
{"instruction": "Trading strategy question", "input": "What is the Opening Range Breakout strategy?", "output": "ORB Strategy: Define range from first 15-30 minutes of trading. Long entry: Break above range high. Short entry: Break below range low. Stop: Opposite side of range or middle. Target: Range width projected from breakout. Best on days with clear direction. Filter: Only trade in direction of pre-market trend."}
{"instruction": "Trading strategy question", "input": "How do I trade gap ups?", "output": "Gap Up trading strategies: 1) Gap and Go: Enter on continuation above pre-market high with volume. Stop below gap. 2) Gap Fill: Fade the gap if weak, expect partial or full fill. 3) Wait for first pullback to VWAP for lower-risk entry. Key filters: Gap > 3%, RVOL > 2x, no major resistance above. Avoid gapping into resistance."}
{"instruction": "Risk management question", "input": "What is the maximum I should risk on a single trade?", "output": "Professional risk management: Maximum 1-2% of account per trade. Conservative traders use 0.5-1%. With $10,000 account, risk $100-200 max per trade. This allows surviving losing streaks. A 10-trade losing streak at 2% = 18% drawdown. Never increase risk to recover losses. Position size accordingly."}
{"instruction": "Risk management question", "input": "How many positions should I have open at once?", "output": "Position limits depend on account size and strategy: Day trading: 1-3 positions. Swing trading: 5-10 positions for diversification. Never let one position exceed 20% of capital. Correlated positions count as increased risk. If holding similar stocks, reduce size. Total portfolio heat (open risk) should not exceed 6%."}
{"instruction": "Risk management question", "input": "When should I take profits?", "output": "Profit-taking strategies: 1) Fixed target: Set at entry, based on R:R. 2) Trailing stop: Move stop to breakeven at 1R, trail at key levels. 3) Partial exits: Sell 1/3 at 1R, 1/3 at 2R, let rest run. 4) Technical exit: Close at resistance or reversal signal. Never let winner become loser - protect profits with trailing stops."}
{"instruction": "Market analysis question", "input": "How do I identify the overall market trend?", "output": "Market trend identification: 1) SPY/QQQ above 20 SMA = short-term bullish. Above 50 SMA = intermediate bullish. Above 200 SMA = long-term bullish. 2) Higher highs and higher lows = uptrend. 3) VIX below 20 = low fear, bullish. Above 30 = high fear, cautious. Trade with the market, not against it."}
{"instruction": "Market analysis question", "input": "What is relative volume and why does it matter?", "output": "Relative Volume (RVOL) compares current volume to average. RVOL = Current Volume / Average Volume. RVOL > 1.5 indicates unusual interest. RVOL > 3.0 indicates significant interest. High RVOL validates breakouts and signals. Low RVOL breakouts often fail. Best setups have RVOL 2x+ with price confirmation."}
{"instruction": "Trading psychology", "input": "How do I handle a losing streak?", "output": "Handling losing streaks: 1) Reduce position size by 50% after 3 consecutive losses. 2) Review trades for pattern - are you forcing? 3) Take a break if emotional. 4) Check if market conditions changed. 5) Never revenge trade. 6) Trust your edge over long term. Losing streaks are normal with even 60% win rate."}
{"instruction": "Trading psychology", "input": "How do I avoid overtrading?", "output": "Preventing overtrading: 1) Set daily trade limit (3-5 trades). 2) Only A+ setups meeting all criteria. 3) No FOMO - another setup will come. 4) Track if bored or trading for excitement. 5) Walk away after hitting daily goal or max loss. 6) Quality over quantity - one good trade beats five mediocre ones."}
{"instruction": "Analyze this scenario", "input": "TSLA gap up 4%, RVOL 3x, RSI 65, above VWAP. Should I buy?", "output": "Analysis: Bullish setup. Gap up 4% shows interest. RVOL 3x confirms participation. RSI 65 elevated but not overbought. Above VWAP is bullish. Recommendation: BUY with caution. Entry: Current or first pullback to VWAP. Stop: Below pre-market low. Target: 1.5-2x ATR. Risk: RSI approaching 70, watch for exhaustion."}
{"instruction": "Analyze this scenario", "input": "Stock breaking out but volume is low. What should I do?", "output": "Low volume breakout analysis: Warning sign - breakouts need volume confirmation. RVOL should be > 1.5x for valid breakout. Low volume breakouts often fail and reverse. Recommendation: WAIT or SKIP. If you enter, use reduced position size. Set tight stop. If volume doesn't pick up within 15 min, exit. Better setups exist."}
{"instruction": "Analyze this scenario", "input": "Price at support with RSI oversold. Good buy?", "output": "Support + RSI oversold analysis: Double confirmation is bullish. Support level held = buyers present. RSI oversold suggests selling exhausted. Recommendation: BUY if uptrend intact. Entry: At support or slight bounce confirmation. Stop: Below support. Target: Previous resistance. Caution: In downtrend, support may break."}
{"instruction": "Analyze this scenario", "input": "MACD bearish crossover but price above 200 SMA. What does this mean?", "output": "Mixed signals analysis: MACD bearish suggests short-term weakness. Price above 200 SMA indicates long-term uptrend intact. Interpretation: Potential pullback in uptrend, not trend reversal. Recommendation: WAIT for pullback to buy. Don't short against 200 SMA. Look for MACD to bottom for entry. This is buying opportunity, not exit signal."}
{"instruction": "Strategy comparison", "input": "Should I use momentum or mean reversion?", "output": "Momentum vs Mean Reversion: Momentum: Follow trends, buy strength, sell weakness. Works in trending markets. Mean Reversion: Buy oversold, sell overbought. Works in ranging markets. Selection: Use momentum in clear trends (stocks above 20 SMA trending). Use mean reversion in choppy, range-bound markets. Adapt to conditions."}
{"instruction": "Day trading specific", "input": "What are the best times to trade during the day?", "output": "Optimal trading times (US market): 9:30-10:30 AM: Most volatile, big moves, higher risk. 10:30-12:00: Settling period, trends establish. 12:00-2:00 PM: Lunch doldrums, avoid. 2:00-4:00 PM: Second wave of activity. Best setups: First hour for momentum, afternoon for reversals. Avoid low liquidity periods."}
{"instruction": "Day trading specific", "input": "How do I handle the first 15 minutes of market open?", "output": "First 15 minutes strategy: Very volatile, high spreads, whipsaw common. Options: 1) Wait and watch - let chaos settle. 2) Define Opening Range (OR) for breakout. 3) Only trade if gap up with strong RVOL. 4) Use smaller size if trading. Most professionals wait 15-30 min for cleaner setups. Patience pays."}
{"instruction": "Swing trading specific", "input": "How long should I hold a swing trade?", "output": "Swing trade holding periods: Typical: 2-10 days. Based on: Time to reach target, not arbitrary duration. Exit when: Target hit, stop hit, or pattern invalidated. Don't hold through earnings unless intentional. Weekend risk: Gaps can hurt. Review weekly for thesis validity. Let winners run with trailing stops."}
{"instruction": "Indicator combination", "input": "Which indicators work well together?", "output": "Effective indicator combinations: 1) RSI + MACD: Momentum confirmation. 2) Moving Averages + Volume: Trend + participation. 3) Bollinger + RSI: Overbought/oversold + volatility. 4) VWAP + Volume Profile: Institutional levels. Avoid: Too many indicators (analysis paralysis). Use 2-3 max. Each should provide unique information."}
{"instruction": "Technical analysis", "input": "How do I identify support and resistance levels?", "output": "Finding S/R levels: 1) Previous highs/lows - price memory. 2) Round numbers ($100, $50). 3) Moving averages (20, 50, 200 SMA). 4) VWAP (intraday). 5) Volume profile peaks. 6) Gap fills. 7) Previous day high/low. Stronger if multiple methods align. More touches = stronger level. Break with volume = confirmed."}
{"instruction": "Volume analysis", "input": "How do I use volume to confirm moves?", "output": "Volume confirmation: Breakout up with high volume = strong, valid. Breakout up with low volume = weak, may fail. Price up, volume up = healthy trend. Price up, volume down = weakening, caution. Price down, volume up = strong selling, avoid. Climactic volume often marks reversals. Volume leads price."}
{"instruction": "Entry timing", "input": "When is the best time to enter a trade?", "output": "Optimal entry timing: 1) At support in uptrend - lowest risk. 2) On breakout with volume confirmation. 3) First pullback after breakout. 4) At VWAP in strong mover. Avoid: Chasing extended moves, entering at resistance, buying into selling. Wait for setup to come to you. Missed entry = wait for next."}
{"instruction": "Exit strategy", "input": "How do I decide when to exit a trade?", "output": "Exit decision framework: Planned exits: 1) Stop loss hit - non-negotiable. 2) Target hit - take profits. 3) Time stop - exit if thesis not working. Dynamic exits: 4) Trailing stop at key levels. 5) Reversal signal appears. 6) Market conditions change. Never: Hope, move stops further, average down on losers."}
{"instruction": "Sector analysis", "input": "How do sector rotations affect my trades?", "output": "Sector rotation impact: Money flows between sectors based on economic cycle. Leading sectors outperform market. Lagging sectors underperform. Strategy: Trade stocks in leading sectors. Check sector ETFs (XLK, XLF, XLE) for relative strength. If your stock's sector is weak, headwind exists. Align trades with sector strength."}
{"instruction": "Pre-market analysis", "input": "How should I analyze pre-market action?", "output": "Pre-market analysis checklist: 1) Gap direction and size (>3% significant). 2) Pre-market volume vs average. 3) News catalyst - why the move? 4) Key levels from previous day. 5) SPY/QQQ direction. 6) Resistance/support in gap path. 7) First target planning. High RVOL + catalyst + clear levels = potential opportunity."}
{"instruction": "News trading", "input": "How do I trade around news and earnings?", "output": "News/earnings trading: Before: Reduce position or exit - gap risk. During: Avoid - unpredictable. After: Wait for dust to settle (15-30 min). Trade reaction, not prediction. Strong earnings + sell-off = potential buy (buyers coming). Weak earnings + rally = potential short. Gap and pattern matter more than news content."}
{"instruction": "Scaling in and out", "input": "Should I enter and exit positions all at once?", "output": "Scaling strategies: Scaling in: 1/3 at initial signal, add 1/3 on confirmation, final 1/3 on strength. Reduces timing risk. Scaling out: Sell 1/3 at 1R, 1/3 at 2R, trail rest. Locks profits, lets winners run. Best for: Uncertain entries, larger positions, volatile stocks. All-in better for: High conviction, small positions."}
{"instruction": "Chart timeframes", "input": "Which timeframe should I use for analysis?", "output": "Multi-timeframe analysis: Higher timeframe (daily): Overall trend direction. Intermediate (hourly/4hr): Swing levels, structure. Lower (15m/5m): Entry timing. Rule: Trade in direction of higher timeframe. Entry on lower timeframe. Don't fight higher timeframe trend. Day traders: 5m entries, 15m structure, daily bias."}
{"instruction": "Trend identification", "input": "How do I know if a stock is trending or ranging?", "output": "Trend vs Range identification: Trending: Price making higher highs/lows (up) or lower highs/lows (down). ADX > 25 confirms trend. Price above/below moving averages. Ranging: Price bouncing between support and resistance. ADX < 20. Moving averages flat and intertwined. Strategy: Momentum in trends, mean reversion in ranges."}
{"instruction": "Candlestick patterns", "input": "What candlestick patterns should I know?", "output": "Essential candlestick patterns: Bullish: Hammer (at support), Engulfing (reversal), Morning Star (reversal). Bearish: Shooting Star (at resistance), Engulfing (reversal), Evening Star (reversal). Continuation: Doji (indecision, needs context). Always confirm with: Volume, location (S/R), higher timeframe. Single candles less reliable than context."}
{"instruction": "Moving average strategy", "input": "How do I use moving averages for trading signals?", "output": "Moving average strategies: 1) Price cross: Buy when price crosses above MA, sell below. 2) MA cross: Buy when fast MA (20) crosses above slow (50). 3) MA as support/resistance: Buy at MA in uptrend, sell at MA in downtrend. Key MAs: 20 (short-term), 50 (intermediate), 200 (long-term). Slope indicates trend strength."}
{"instruction": "Gap trading", "input": "What types of gaps exist and how do I trade them?", "output": "Gap types: Breakaway: Starts new trend, often doesn't fill soon. Runaway: Middle of trend, trend continuation. Exhaustion: End of trend, often fills. Common: Regular gap, usually fills. Trading: Breakaway - trade in gap direction. Exhaustion - fade. Common - wait for fill. Always check: Volume, news catalyst, previous structure."}
{"instruction": "Divergence trading", "input": "What is divergence and how do I trade it?", "output": "Divergence types: Bullish: Price makes lower low, indicator makes higher low. Signals potential reversal up. Bearish: Price makes higher high, indicator makes lower high. Signals potential reversal down. Common indicators: RSI, MACD. Entry: After price confirms reversal, not on divergence alone. More reliable at support/resistance."}
{"instruction": "Risk per trade", "input": "How do I calculate my risk per trade?", "output": "Risk calculation: 1) Determine account risk: 1% of $10,000 = $100. 2) Find stop distance: Entry $50, Stop $48 = $2. 3) Calculate position: $100 / $2 = 50 shares. 4) Verify position value: 50 × $50 = $2,500 (25% of account - acceptable). Formula: Risk $ / (Entry - Stop) = Shares. Always calculate before entering."}
{"instruction": "Win rate and expectancy", "input": "What win rate do I need to be profitable?", "output": "Win rate requirements depend on R:R: At 1:1 R:R, need >50% win rate. At 1:2 R:R, need >33% win rate. At 1:3 R:R, need >25% win rate. Expectancy = (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss). Positive expectancy = profitable over time. Focus on: Good R:R + consistent execution > high win rate. Quality setups naturally improve win rate."}
{"instruction": "Trade journal", "input": "What should I track in my trading journal?", "output": "Trading journal essentials: Entry: Date, symbol, entry price, position size, setup type. Exit: Exit price, P/L, reason for exit. Analysis: What worked, what didn't, emotions. Statistics: Win rate, average win/loss, R:R, profit factor. Review weekly for patterns. Screenshots of setup and outcome. Track psychology - emotions affect decisions."}
{"instruction": "Market conditions", "input": "How do market conditions affect my strategy?", "output": "Adapting to conditions: Bull market: More longs, higher win rate on breakouts. Bear market: More selective, quicker profits, avoid longs. Choppy market: Reduce size, take smaller wins, avoid breakouts. High VIX: Wider stops needed, reduce position size. Low VIX: Tighter stops possible. No strategy works in all conditions - adapt."}
{"instruction": "Analyzing similar trades", "input": "Given past trades on NVDA with gap ups, what should I expect?", "output": "Historical pattern analysis: Review past NVDA gap ups for: Average move after gap, fill rate, best entry point, holding period. If 70% of similar gaps continued with 3%+ gain, odds favor continuation. If gaps filled 60% of time, wait for pullback. Use memory to inform, not dictate. Current context matters. Past doesn't guarantee future."}
{"instruction": "Pattern failure", "input": "What do I do when a pattern fails?", "output": "Handling pattern failure: 1) Accept it - no pattern works 100%. 2) Exit at predetermined stop - non-negotiable. 3) Don't double down. 4) Document for learning. 5) Move on - next setup exists. Prevention: Confirm patterns with volume, wait for trigger, use proper position sizing. Failed patterns sometimes become reverse signals - head fake then opposite."}
{"instruction": "Position management", "input": "A trade is going my way. Should I add to the position?", "output": "Adding to winners: Acceptable if: Original thesis intact, price confirms (higher high), adding at valid level (pullback to support). Method: Add smaller size (1/2 of original), move stop to breakeven on original. Don't add: Near target, after extended run, out of greed. Pyramiding can accelerate gains but also losses."}
{"instruction": "Stop loss management", "input": "Should I move my stop loss?", "output": "Stop loss management: Move TO: Breakeven after 1R profit (free trade). Trail below swing lows in uptrend. Never move: Further away from entry (hope trade). Move closer: Only if valid new structure forms. Rules: Let trade breathe but protect capital. Too tight = stopped out unnecessarily. Too loose = excess risk."}
{"instruction": "Market correlation", "input": "How does the overall market affect individual stock trades?", "output": "Market correlation impact: Most stocks correlate with SPY (0.5-0.8). Strong market lifts most stocks. Weak market sinks most stocks. Strategy: Check SPY before trading. Trade with market direction. Strong stocks in weak market = relative strength (bullish). Weak stocks in strong market = relative weakness (bearish). Fight the market = lower probability."}
